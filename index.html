  <h1>Stamped Data Tagging System for Physics and Lighting</h1>
  <p><strong>By Teromen</strong></p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    I’m an amateur level designer fascinated by how engines handle large-scale environments, and I’ve been brainstorming a theoretical system that I’d love to get feedback on — especially from anyone with programming or engine experience.
  </p>

  <h2>The Core Idea</h2>
  <p>
    Rather than relying on dense geometry or heavy shaders everywhere, what if an engine used <strong>stamped data</strong> — similar to <em>MegaTexture</em> decals — not just for visuals, but for <strong>physics</strong> and <strong>lighting</strong> information as well?
  </p>
  <p>
    These stamps could include <code>16-bit normal maps</code> (or similar precision) that represent physical surface properties like:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bump height</li>
    <li>Surface friction</li>
    <li>Impact reaction zones</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Vector Path Tracing Concept</h2>
  <p>
    Alongside this, I’m imagining a <strong>vector path tracing system</strong> — not necessarily full real-time ray tracing — but something that leverages vector data to simulate:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Light bounce and diffusion</li>
    <li>Material influence</li>
    <li>Ambient energy transfer</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    It could be optimized for large, detailed environments without taxing the GPU like traditional RT.
  </p>

  <h2>Why This?</h2>
  <p>
    The goal is a <strong>lightweight system</strong> for delivering realistic lighting and material response, especially in open-world or dense indoor scenes. Instead of real-time geometry or lighting updates, the system would rely on:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pre-tagged physical surface maps</li>
    <li>Data stamps placed by designers or automated tooling</li>
    <li>Efficient logic lookups for physics and lighting behavior</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Questions for the Community</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Does anything like this already exist in engines or tools?</li>
    <li>Could a simplified version be implemented using scripting?</li>
    <li>Are “tagged” surface behaviors used anywhere else that I might not know about?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I’m tossing this out as a thought experiment and would love to hear what others think!
