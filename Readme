# MEGA-Data: Stamped AI Framework for Scalable World Modeling

**Physics-stamped, light-aware AI framework for scalable world modeling and forensic analysis.**

MEGA-Data is an innovative architecture and data framework designed to enable highly detailed environmental simulations, anomaly detection, and light-behavior modeling using metadata-enhanced geospatial tiles. Built to run efficiently on consumer-grade GPUs, MEGA-Data empowers researchers, analysts, and investigators with forensic-grade tools for a wide range of real-world applications.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Light-Aware Intelligence**  
  AI models interpret photon behavior — such as reflection, refraction, and shadow casting — within the environment.

- **Physics-Stamped Tiling System**  
  Every data tile includes physical metadata: shadow depth, occlusion zones, specular surfaces, and more.

- **Mega-Scale Tiling Architecture**  
  Organizes vast datasets into GPU-optimized, layered tiles to support real-time rendering and interaction.

- **Scripted Detail Stamps**  
  Programmable overlays add refined, context-aware metadata for forensic reconstruction or scene simulation.

## 🕵️ Use Cases

- **Forensic Scene Reconstruction**  
  Analyze light-based inconsistencies or simulate crime scenes remotely with high fidelity.

- **Environmental Modeling**  
  Create large-scale world models with realistic light behavior and physical attributes.

- **AI-Assisted Anomaly Detection**  
  Detect tampering, staging, or physical impossibilities based on how light interacts with the scene.

- **Citizen Science & Remote Investigation**  
  Perform advanced forensic assessments from a standard desktop GPU.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Modern GPU (NVIDIA or AMD with OpenCL/CUDA support recommended)
- Python (for scripting metadata overlays and AI logic)
- [Optional] Integration with Unreal Engine or similar for visualization

## 🧠 Philosophy

> “A drop of DNA at a scene might pass chemical tests,  
> but if the shadow angle, material reflectivity, or time-of-day coherence is off,  
> MEGA-Data can detect the manipulation — acting as a forensic lie detector for reality.”
